Prepare for an upcoming meeting by gathering context on attendees and related topics.

## Tone Calibration

Before executing this command, read `System/user-profile.yaml` → `communication` section and adapt:

**Career Level Adaptations:**
- **Junior:** Provide more context about attendees, suggest preparation tips
- **Mid:** Balance context with action, suggest talking points
- **Senior/Leadership:** Strategic framing, influence opportunities, key decisions
- **C-Suite:** High-level strategic context, organizational implications, key stakeholders

**Directness:**
- **Very direct:** Bullet points, key facts only
- **Balanced:** Context + talking points (default)
- **Supportive:** Detailed prep, conversation strategies

**Detail Level:**
- **Concise:** Names, roles, top 3 talking points
- **Balanced:** Standard prep format
- **Comprehensive:** Full context, relationship dynamics, strategic considerations

See COPILOT.md → "Communication Adaptation" for full guidelines.

## Arguments

**Optional:** $MEETING, $ATTENDEES

If not provided, prompt the user for:
1. Meeting topic or title
2. List of attendees (comma-separated names)

**Examples:**
- `meeting prep "Q1 Planning" "Sarah Chen, Mike Rodriguez"`
- "prep for meeting" (then prompt for details)

## What This Does

1. Looks up each attendee in `People/` folder
2. Surfaces recent interactions and open action items
3. Checks for related projects
4. Suggests talking points based on context

## Process

### Step 0: Gather Context (if needed)

**If $MEETING or $ATTENDEES are not provided:**

Ask: "Which meeting are you prepping for?"
- Get meeting topic/title

Ask: "Who's attending? (comma-separated names or just list them)"
- Accept formats: "Sarah Chen, Mike Rodriguez" or "Sarah, Mike" or natural list
- Parse into individual attendee names

### Step 1: Attendee Lookup

For each attendee in $ATTENDEES:

1. Search `05-Areas/People/Internal/` and `05-Areas/People/External/` for matching names
2. If found, extract:
   - Role and company
   - Last interaction date
   - Open action items involving them
   - Key context or notes

3. If not found, note: "No person page for [Name] - consider creating one after the meeting"

### Step 2: Related Projects

Search `04-Projects/` for any projects that:
- Mention the attendees
- Relate to the meeting topic ($MEETING)

Extract:
- Project name and status
- Relevant milestones or blockers
- Recent updates

### Step 3: Recent Context

Search `00-Inbox/Meetings/` for recent meetings with these attendees:
- What was discussed?
- What was decided?
- What follow-ups were committed?

---

### Step 3b: Integration Context (if available)

Check `System/integrations/config.yaml` to see which integrations are enabled.

**Notion Integration:**
If `enabled.notion: true` AND Notion MCP is available:
```
Search Notion for pages related to:
- Meeting topic ($MEETING)
- Attendee names

Include in prep:
- Relevant Notion docs (title + summary)
- Shared pages with attendees
```

**Slack Integration:**
If `enabled.slack: true` AND WorkIQ is available:
```
Search Slack for recent conversations:
- With/about each attendee
- Mentioning the meeting topic

Include in prep:
- Recent Slack context (last 7 days)
- Key threads or decisions
- Any commitments made
```

**Teams Integration:**
If `teams.enabled: true` AND WorkIQ available:
```
Search Teams chats with attendees:
- Recent 1:1 and group chats involving each attendee
- Mentioning the meeting topic

Check Teams channels related to meeting topic:
- Project channels, department channels
- Recent posts and replies

Surface recent decisions from Teams threads:
- Key decisions made in channel conversations
- Any commitments or follow-ups from Teams chats

Include in prep:
- Recent Teams context (last 7 days)
- Key threads or decisions from channels
- Any commitments made in Teams chats
```

**When BOTH Slack and Teams are enabled:**
- Check both sources for each attendee
- Label context by source: "**From Slack:**" / "**From Teams:**"
- Deduplicate if the same person appears in both (merge context, label the source)
- Present in separate sub-sections under Integration Context

**Google Workspace Integration:**
If `google-workspace.enabled: true` AND WorkIQ is available:
```
Search Gmail for recent threads with each attendee (last 7 days):
- Email exchanges and their topics
- Shared Google Docs mentioned in threads
- Outstanding email requests (sent but no reply)

Search for Google Docs related to:
- Meeting topic ($MEETING)
- Shared documents with attendees

Include in prep:
- Recent email exchanges (last 7 days) — key threads summarized
- Shared documents — Google Docs, Sheets, or Slides linked in emails
- Outstanding requests/follow-ups — emails waiting > 48h for reply
```

**Graceful Degradation:**
If an integration is enabled but the MCP isn't responding:
- Skip silently
- Don't show error to user
- Continue with vault-only context

- Create person pages for new contacts after meetings
- Update this context regularly for accurate prep
