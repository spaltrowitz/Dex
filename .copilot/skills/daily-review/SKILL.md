description: End of day review with learning capture, daily plan completion tracking, and meeting follow-up surfacing.
---
## Purpose

Conduct an end-of-day review to capture progress, track what you actually accomplished vs. planned, surface meeting follow-ups, and set up tomorrow.

## Tone Calibration

Read `System/user-profile.yaml` → `communication` section and adapt accordingly.

---


## Step 1: File Discovery

Find files modified TODAY:

```bash
TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
find . -type f -name "*.md" -newermt "$TODAY 00:00:00" ! -newermt "$TODAY 23:59:59" 2>/dev/null
```

**Critical rules:**
1. No truncation — list all modified files
2. Today only — use date-based filtering
3. Verify with user — "These are the files I found. What did you actually work on?"

---

## Step 2: Gather Context

### From 03-Tasks/Tasks.md
- Tasks completed today (look for `✅ YYYY-MM-DD` matching today)
- Tasks started but not finished

### From Weekly Priorities
Read `02-Week_Priorities/Week_Priorities.md` for:
- This week's strategic focus
- How today's work connects to weekly priorities

### From Recent Meetings
Check `00-Inbox/Meetings/` for meeting notes from today.

---

## Step 2.6: Reminders Completion Sync (Dex Today → Dex)

Check if tasks were completed on phone since the morning plan:

```
Use: reminders_list_completed(list_name="Dex Today")
```

For each completed item:
- Match to a Dex task by title
- Update task status via Work MCP: `update_task_status(task_title="...", status="d")`
- Surface what was synced:

> "📱 **Synced from phone:**
> - ✅ "Follow up with Hero Coders" — marked done in Dex"

Also check for tasks completed in Dex today that still have active Reminders:

```
# For each task completed today in Dex, check if a matching Reminder exists
Use: reminders_find_and_complete(list_name="Dex Today", title_query="task title")
```

Clean up completed items:
```
Use: reminders_clear_completed(list_name="Dex Today")
```

**If nothing to sync:** Skip silently.

---

## Step 3: Daily Plan Completion Tracking (NEW)

**Compare what you planned vs. what you did.**

### 3.1 Find Today's Plan

Look for `07-Archives/Plans/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today's date).

### 3.2 Extract Planned Focus

From the "Today's Focus" section, extract the 3 items you planned to focus on.

### 3.3 Track Completion

For each planned focus item:
- Check if it was completed (look in Tasks.md for completion timestamps)
- Check if it was started but not finished
- Check if it was blocked or deferred

**Surface this:**

> "📊 **Daily Plan Completion:**
> 
> You planned 3 focus items this morning:
> 
> 1. ✅ **Prep for Acme meeting** — Complete
> 2. 🔄 **Write pricing proposal** — In progress (about 60% done)
> 3. ❌ **Reply to Mike** — Didn't get to it
> 
> **Completion rate today:** 1 of 3 (33%)
> 
> What happened with #3? Should it carry to tomorrow?"

### 3.4 Track Over Time (Optional)

If tracking completion rates:
- Update `System/metrics/daily-completion.md` with today's rate
- Surface patterns: "Your average completion rate this week is 67%"

---

## Step 4: Meeting Follow-Up Surfacing (NEW)

**For each meeting you had today, surface follow-ups.**

### 4.1 Identify Today's Meetings

From calendar or meeting notes, list meetings that happened today.

### 4.2 For Each Meeting, Ask:

```
Use: get_meeting_context(meeting_title="...", attendees=[...])
```

Then prompt:

> "📍 **You met with Sarah Chen today** (Acme Quarterly Review)
> 
> **Any follow-ups to capture?**
> - Action items you committed to?
> - Things they owe you?
> - Decisions that need documentation?
> 
> (Type your follow-ups or 'none')"

### 4.3 Create Follow-Up Tasks

For any follow-ups mentioned:
- Add to Tasks.md with appropriate priority
- Link to the person page
- Add due date if mentioned

---

## Step 5: Progress Assessment

With user-verified information:
- What was accomplished?
- What progress was made against weekly priorities?
- What got stuck or blocked?
- What unexpected things came up?

---

## Step 6: Week Progress Check (Midweek Context)

```
Use: get_week_progress()
```

Show how today's work moved weekly priorities:

> "**Week Progress Update:**
> 
> After today, you're at:
> - Priority 1: ✅ Complete (finished today!)
> - Priority 2: 🔄 60% (moved from 40%)
> - Priority 3: ⚠️ Still not started
> 
> You have 2 days left. Tomorrow should focus on Priority 3."

---

## Step 7: Auto-Extract Session Learnings

Scan today's conversation for learnings:

1. **Mistakes or corrections** — Did something not work as expected?
2. **Preferences mentioned** — Did you express how you like to work?
3. **Documentation gaps** — Were there questions about how the system works?
4. **Workflow inefficiencies** — Did any task take longer than it should?

Write to `System/Session_Learnings/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

Then ask: "I captured [N] learnings from today's session. Anything else you'd like to add?"

---

## Step 8: Categorize Learnings (If Applicable)

Check if any learnings should be elevated to pattern files:
- **Recurring mistakes** → `06-Resources/Learnings/Mistake_Patterns.md`
- **Workflow preferences** → `06-Resources/Learnings/Working_Preferences.md`

Get user confirmation before adding.

---

## Step 9: Tomorrow's Setup

Based on:
- Incomplete items from today
- Weekly priorities (especially lagging ones)
- Commitments due tomorrow
- Tomorrow's calendar shape

Suggest 3 focus items for tomorrow:

> "**Suggested focus for tomorrow (Thursday):**
> 
> 1. **Priority 3** — It's been untouched all week and you have 2 days left
> 2. **Finish pricing proposal** — 40% left, should be quick to complete
> 3. **Reply to Mike** — Carried from today
> 
> Tomorrow's shape: Moderate (4 meetings). You have a 2-hour block in the afternoon.
> 
> Does this feel right?"

---

## Step 9.5: Retrospective Insight (Innovation Concierge)

At the end of the review, check if there's a relevant backlog idea to surface:

1. Call `list_ideas(status="active", min_score=70)` from Improvements MCP
2. Look for ideas that connect to today's work or learnings:
   - Did the user work on tasks related to a backlog idea?
   - Did learnings captured today strengthen an existing idea?
   - Is there a "Why Now?" idea with fresh evidence?
3. If a relevant match exists, surface it briefly:

> **Retrospective Insight:** Today's meeting processing struggles connect to idea-027 (RAG-Powered Vault Search) — semantic search could make finding meeting context much faster. Worth exploring? Run "dex improve".

**Rules:**
- Show at most 1 insight per review
- Only show if genuinely connected to today's work (not random)
- Frame as retrospective — "based on what you just did, here's what could help"
- If no connection, skip entirely
- Keep it to 1-2 lines max

---

## Step 11: Evening Journal (If Enabled)

If `journaling.evening: true`, prompt for evening reflection.

---

## Output Format

Create `07-Archives/Reviews/Daily_Review_YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

```markdown

---

## Step 12: Skill Quality Check (Gentle)

After generating the review, call `get_skill_ratings(skill_name="daily-review")` from Work MCP.

**If 3+ ratings exist and average has dropped below 3.0 over the last 5 entries:**
Add one line at the end of the review output:
> "Your daily reviews have been averaging [X]/5 lately. Common note: '[most recent note]'. Want to adjust the format?"

**If no ratings exist or average is 3.0+:** Say nothing. Don't mention ratings at all.

**Then:** Run "update identity snapshot" silently in the background if `System/identity-model.md` is older than 7 days (check file mtime). Don't announce this.
